      <p> The power struggle between the politically powerful Mohana Ranga and the Devineni family led to the splitting of the <b>United Independent Organization</b>b> and to the alleged protracted murders of brothers Devineni Chandrasekhar (Gandhi) in 1979 and Devineni Murali in 1988.[1][2] Subsequently, while Ranga was staging an indefinite fast for distribution of land pattas to residents of Giripuram, he was attacked by a group of men allegedly led by Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru), who attacked Mohana Ranga's camp and assassinated him in the early hours of 26 December 1988. Ranga's two assigned bodyguards did not intervene.[3][4] The murder led to large-scale riots in erstwhile Krishna, Guntur and the Godavari districts.[       </p>

<h1>POLITICAL CAREER</h1>
<p>Vangaveeti Ranga entered public life after the death of his elder brother Vangaveeti Radha Krishna Sr. His political career began in 1981, when he ran in the municipal election and the Congress Party withdrew its candidate in his favor. His rival in the district, Devineni Rajasekhar, (Nehru), was sponsored by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).[3] Ranga became an MLA for the Congress Party in 1985; Rajasekhar became a TDP MLA, and eventually a minister.[1] Starting in 1983 both parties were implicated in gang warfare; N. T. Rama Rao was at the time the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.[3] The gang warfare in Vijayawada dated further back; Ranga had served time in prison for the murder of Rajasekhar's brother Gandhi.[1] On 10 March 1988, Rajasekhar's one more brother Murali was killed, and followers of Ranga were accused. Ranga also campaigned against police abuse. On 10 July 1988, a rally called Kapunadu proclaimed him leader of the Kapus; he was in prison at the time, but after his release later that month began a bus tour called Jana Chaitanya Yatra "to expose the autocratic rule and misdeeds of Rama Rao". Rao had come to power after a van tour.[3]</p>
